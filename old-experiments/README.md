# Old Experiments

This is a collection of older experiments worked on in free time, rewriting most of the base functionality of `dreamlab-core` while changing/fixing any glaring errors.

> This should not be treated as a base to work off of, it is provided as reference and should be used to cherry-pick good ideas and inspire the next version of Dreamlab.
